# Incorrect Quote generator

## What is it?

A small webpage thrown together by me that generates incorrect quotes based on the names you enter.
The quotes are all taken (with permission) from [here](https://incorrect-quotes-generator.neocities.org/).
I started with most of the code from there as well, but I found it so bad that I ended up rewriting (almost) all of it.
You can see a live version [here](https://jemand2001.github.io/incorrect_quotes/), or host it on your machine using any static file server.

## Contributing

If you see anything you think can be improved, or want to add a quote, feel free to send it as a reply to issue [#2](https://github.com/jemand2001/incorrect_quotes/issues/2) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/jemand2001/incorrect_quotes/pulls). I can't guarantee that I'll take care of everything, but I'll certainly try.
